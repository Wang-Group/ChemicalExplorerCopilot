# llm_lab_benchmark

## Overview

This repository contains resources and code used when interfacing with the AI agent during the exploration.

## Getting Started

To get started with the package for exploration, follow these steps:

Install the required of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [our webapp](./internal_dependencies/nl2code_web/).

Then install the [llmlab](./llmlab) package for exploration:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

The webapp can then be lanuched by running the [test.py](./internal_dependencies//nl2code_web//NL2CodeWebApp//test.py) through [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), which can be utilized by the GPT.

Note to fill the api keys in [constant.py](./llmlab/constant.py) before using the services from OpenAI api and the ChemSpide.
   ```bash
   open_ai_api_key = "<input your api key here>"
   chemspider_api_key = '<input your api key here>'
   ```
## Additional Content
1. [Agent_exploration](./Agent_exploration) contains all the experimental procedures generated by the copilot. 
2. [examples](./examples) contains:
   - the [examples](./examples/ExampleWithComments/) offered to the copilot when interfacing with humans during the exploration of Mn-W clusters, for in-context learning.
   - the generated codes from the examples in the form of [xdl 2.0](https://croningroup.gitlab.io/chemputer/xdl/standard/index.html), which is converted through the [xdl_link](./examples/xdl_conversion/xdl_conversion.ipynb).
